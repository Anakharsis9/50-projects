# 50 projects - HTML/CSS and JavaScript
The idea and inspiration was taken from [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days).

This is a small challenge where I do at least one project every day.

| № | Project | Live Demo |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Expanding Cards  |
| 2 | Progress Steps  |
